# Minimal Black & White Website

## Description
This project is a seven-page responsive website created as part of a web development assignment.  
It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to build and style web pages, as well as implement interactive and dynamic features.

The website follows a monochrome (black and white) design theme and includes:
- A global navigation bar and footer consistent across all pages  
- Individual CSS and JS files for each page  
- Dynamic content updates using JavaScript  
- A form that uses `localStorage` to persist user input  
- External data loaded via the `fetch()` API  
- Deployment through GitHub Pages
